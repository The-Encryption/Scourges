# Data organisation

The repository is organised into 6 main folders: P³, biology, characters, history, social, and technology.
Each of these folders will contain a similar file wherein the sub-folders' content will be described. 

## P³
This folder is to contain anything and everything related to the structure and physics of P³, an overlaying space where consciousness exists in the Scourge universe. 

## Biology
Everything related to the biology of the Scourges is to be written as popularised science literature.

## History 
Scourges exist not as static points in time, but as things always in existence at those points.
In other words, when talking about events that happen in the past relative to the current time, don't use the past tense, same for the future events. 

## Social 
Scourges are different from humans in that they do not stratify their society, as each Scourge finds its own way after being conjured.

## Technology
Firstly, Scourges are not fans of mass production. They prefer to create just as much as the they require. 
Secondly, they are generally more advanced than humans, and make important inventions far earlier (e.g. steam power in 350 b. c.).

## Characters
All characters are by default owned by their creators.
When writing something related to a character owned by somebody else, consult them first.
